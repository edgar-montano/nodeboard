## Overview

1. Created a form so you can [register](http://localhost:3000/register), and also created a form so you can add a new class (NOTE: MUST BE REGISTERED AND LOGGED IN TO ADD NEW CLASS:) [login](http://localhost:3000/login) then afterwards: [create classroom](http://localhost:3000/classroom/create) to create classroom
